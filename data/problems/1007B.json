    "statement": "You are given a rectangular parallelepiped with sides of positive integer lengths A, B and C. \nFind the number of different groups of three integers (a, b, c) such that 1 a b c and parallelepiped A B C can be paved with parallelepipeds a b c. Note, that all small parallelepipeds have to be rotated in the same direction.\nFor example, parallelepiped 1 5 6 can be divided into parallelepipeds 1 3 5, but can not be divided into parallelepipeds 1 2 3.\nThe first line contains a single integer t (1  t  10^5) — the number of test cases.\nEach of the next t lines contains three integers A, B and C (1  A, B, C  10^5) — the sizes of the parallelepiped.\nFor each test case, print the number of different groups of three points that satisfy all given conditions.\nIn the first test case, rectangular parallelepiped (1, 1, 1) can be only divided into rectangular parallelepiped with sizes (1, 1, 1).\nIn the second test case, rectangular parallelepiped (1, 6, 1) can be divided into rectangular parallelepipeds with sizes (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 3) and (1, 1, 6).\nIn the third test case, rectangular parallelepiped (2, 2, 2) can be divided into rectangular parallelepipeds with sizes (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 2, 2) and (2, 2, 2).
