  "title": "B. Pave the Parallelepiped",
  "statement": "You are given a rectangular parallelepiped with sides of positive integer lengths $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$ and $$$C$$$.\nFind the number of different groups of three integers ($$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, $$$c$$$) such that $$$1\\leq a\\leq b\\leq c$$$ and parallelepiped $$$A\\times B\\times C$$$ can be paved with parallelepipeds $$$a\\times b\\times c$$$. Note, that all small parallelepipeds have to be rotated in the same direction.\nFor example, parallelepiped $$$1\\times 5\\times 6$$$ can be divided into parallelepipeds $$$1\\times 3\\times 5$$$, but can not be divided into parallelepipeds $$$1\\times 2\\times 3$$$.\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of test cases.\nEach of the next $$$t$$$ lines contains three integers $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$ and $$$C$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A, B, C \\leq 10^5$$$) — the sizes of the parallelepiped.\nFor each test case, print the number of different groups of three points that satisfy all given conditions.\nIn the first test case, rectangular parallelepiped $$$(1, 1, 1)$$$ can be only divided into rectangular parallelepiped with sizes $$$(1, 1, 1)$$$.\nIn the second test case, rectangular parallelepiped $$$(1, 6, 1)$$$ can be divided into rectangular parallelepipeds with sizes $$$(1, 1, 1)$$$, $$$(1, 1, 2)$$$, $$$(1, 1, 3)$$$ and $$$(1, 1, 6)$$$.\nIn the third test case, rectangular parallelepiped $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ can be divided into rectangular parallelepipeds with sizes $$$(1, 1, 1)$$$, $$$(1, 1, 2)$$$, $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$.",
