  "statement": "A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters \"(\" and \")\". A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters \"1\" and \"+\" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences \"()()\" and \"(())\" are regular (the resulting expressions are: \"(1)+(1)\" and \"((1+1)+1)\"), and \")(\", \"(\" and \")\" are not.\nSubsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\nYou are given a regular bracket sequence $$$s$$$ and an integer number $$$k$$$. Your task is to find a regular bracket sequence of length exactly $$$k$$$ such that it is also a subsequence of $$$s$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that such sequence always exists.\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \\le k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$, both $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ are even) — the length of $$$s$$$ and the length of the sequence you are asked to find.\nThe second line is a string $$$s$$$ — regular bracket sequence of length $$$n$$$.\nPrint a single string — a regular bracket sequence of length exactly $$$k$$$ such that it is also a subsequence of $$$s$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that such sequence always exists.",
