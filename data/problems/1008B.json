    "title": "B. Turn the Rectangles",
    "statement": "There are n rectangles in a row. You can either turn each rectangle by 90 degrees or leave it as it is. If you turn a rectangle, its width will be height, and its height will be width. Notice that you can turn any number of rectangles, you also can turn all or none of them. You can not change the order of the rectangles.\nFind out if there is a way to make the rectangles go in order of non-ascending height. In other words, after all the turns, a height of every rectangle has to be not greater than the height of the previous rectangle (if it is such). \nThe first line contains a single integer n (1  n  10^5) — the number of rectangles.\nEach of the next n lines contains two integers w_i and h_i (1  w_i, h_i  10^9) — the width and the height of the i-th rectangle.\nPrint \"YES\" (without quotes) if there is a way to make the rectangles go in order of non-ascending height, otherwise print \"NO\".\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\nIn the first test, you can rotate the second and the third rectangles so that the heights will be [4, 4, 3].\nIn the second test, there is no way the second rectangle will be not higher than the first one.",
