  "statement": "A sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ is called good if, for each element $$$a_i$$$, there exists an element $$$a_j$$$ ($$$i \\ne j$$$) such that $$$a_i+a_j$$$ is a power of two (that is, $$$2^d$$$ for some non-negative integer $$$d$$$).\nFor example, the following sequences are good:\nNote that, by definition, an empty sequence (with a length of $$$0$$$) is good.\nFor example, the following sequences are not good:\nYou are given a sequence $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$. What is the minimum number of elements you need to remove to make it good? You can delete an arbitrary set of elements.\nThe first line contains the integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 120000$$$) â€” the length of the given sequence.\nThe second line contains the sequence of integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$$$).\nPrint the minimum number of elements needed to be removed from the given sequence in order to make it good. It is possible that you need to delete all $$$n$$$ elements, make it empty, and thus get a good sequence.\nIn the first example, it is enough to delete one element $$$a_4=5$$$. The remaining elements form the sequence $$$[4, 7, 1, 4, 9]$$$, which is good.",
