What is the minimum number of elements you need to remove to make it good? You can delete an arbitrary set of elements.\nThe first line contains the integer n (1  n  120000) — the length of the given sequence.\nThe second line contains the sequence of integers a_1, a_2, , a_n (1  a_i  10^9).\nPrint the minimum number of elements needed to be removed from the given sequence in order to make it good. It is possible that you need to delete all n elements, make it empty, and thus get a good sequence.\nIn the first example, it is enough to delete one element a_4=5. The remaining elements form the sequence [4, 7, 1, 4, 9], which is good.",
