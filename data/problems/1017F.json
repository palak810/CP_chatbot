    "statement": "Notice: unusual memory limit!\nAfter the war, destroyed cities in the neutral zone were restored. And children went back to school.\nThe war changed the world, as well as education. In those hard days, a new math concept was created.\nAs we all know, logarithm function can be described as:  (p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}...p_k^{a_2}) = a_1  p_1 + a_2  p_2 + ... + a_k  p_k  Where p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}...p_k^{a_2} is the prime factorization of a integer. A problem is that the function uses itself in the definition. That is why it is hard to calculate.\nSo, the mathematicians from the neutral zone invented this:  {exlog}_f(p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}...p_k^{a_2}) = a_1 f(p_1) + a_2 f(p_2) + ... + a_k f(p_k) \nNotice that {exlog}_f(1) is always equal to 0.\nThis concept for any function f was too hard for children. So teachers told them that f can only be a polynomial of degree no more than 3 in daily uses (i.e., f(x) = Ax^3+Bx^2+Cx+D).\n\"Class is over! Don't forget to do your homework!\" Here it is:  _{i=1}^n {exlog}_f(i) \nHelp children to do their homework. Since the value can be very big, you need to find the answer modulo 2^{32}.\nThe only line contains five integers n, A, B, C, and D (1  n  3  10^8, 0  A,B,C,D  10^6).\nPrint the answer modulo 2^{32}.\nIn the first sample:\n{exlog}_f(1) = 0\n{exlog}_f(2) = 2\n{exlog}_f(3) = 3\n{exlog}_f(4) = 2 + 2 = 4\n{exlog}_f(5) = 5\n{exlog}_f(6) = 2 + 3 = 5\n{exlog}_f(7) = 7\n{exlog}_f(8) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6\n{exlog}_f(9) = 3 + 3 = 6\n{exlog}_f(10) = 2 + 5 = 7\n{exlog}_f(11) = 11\n{exlog}_f(12) = 2 + 2 + 3 = 7\n _{i=1}^{12} {exlog}_f(i)=63 \nIn the second sample:\n{exlog}_f(1) = 0\n{exlog}_f(2) = (1  2^3 + 2  2^2 + 3  2 + 4) = 26\n{exlog}_f(3) = (1  3^3 + 2  3^2 + 3  3 + 4) = 58\n{exlog}_f(4) = 2  {exlog}_f(2) = 52\n _{i=1}^4 {exlog}_f(i)=0+26+58+52=136 ",
