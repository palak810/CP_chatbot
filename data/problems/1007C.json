  "statement": "This is an interactive problem.\nVasya and Vitya play a game. Vasya thought of two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and Vitya tries to guess them. Each round he tells Vasya two numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. If both $$$x=a$$$ and $$$y=b$$$ then Vitya wins. Else Vasya must say one of the three phrases:\nVasya can't lie, but if multiple phrases are true, he may choose any of them. For example, if Vasya thought of numbers $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$, then he answers with the phrase $$$3$$$ to a query $$$(3, 4)$$$, and he can answer with the phrase $$$1$$$ or phrase $$$3$$$ to a query $$$(1, 5)$$$.\nHelp Vitya win in no more than $$$600$$$ rounds.\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{18}$$$) — the upper limit of the numbers.\nFirst, you need to read the number $$$n$$$, after that you can make queries.\nTo make a query, print two integers: $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x, y \\leq n$$$), then flush the output.\nAfter each query, read a single integer $$$ans$$$ ($$$0 \\leq ans \\leq 3$$$).\nIf $$$ans > 0$$$, then it is the number of the phrase said by Vasya.\nIf $$$ans = 0$$$, it means that you win and your program should terminate.\nIf you make more than $$$600$$$ queries or make an incorrect query, you will get Wrong Answer.\nYour solution will get Idleness Limit Exceeded, if you don't print anything or forget to flush the output.\nTo flush you need to do the following right after printing a query and a line end:\nHacks format\nFor hacks, use the following format:\nIn the first line, print a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{18}$$$) — the upper limit of the numbers.\nIn the second line, print two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$) — the numbers which Vasya thought of.\nIn the third line, print a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of instructions for the interactor.\nIn each of the next $$$m$$$ lines, print five integers: $$$x_i$$$, $$$y_i$$$, $$$r^{12}_i$$$, $$$r^{13}_i$$$, and $$$r^{23}_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x_i, y_i \\leq n$$$), where $$$r^{ST}_i$$$ equals to either number $$$S$$$ or number $$$T$$$.\nWhile answering the query $$$x\\,\\, y$$$, the interactor finds a number $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ with the minimal value $$$|x-x_i| + |y-y_i|$$$. If multiple numbers can be chosen, the least $$$i$$$ is preferred. Then the interactor answers to the query, but if there are two phrases $$$S$$$ and $$$T$$$ that can be given, then $$$r^{ST}_i$$$ is chosen.\nFor example, the sample test data file contains the following:\nLet's analyze the sample test. The chosen numbers are $$$2$$$ and $$$4$$$. The interactor was given two instructions.\nFor the query $$$(4, 3)$$$, it can return $$$2$$$ or $$$3$$$. Out of the two instructions the second one is chosen, so the interactor returns $$$a^{23}_2=3$$$.\nFor the query $$$(3, 4)$$$, it can return only $$$3$$$.\nFor the query $$$(3, 3)$$$, it can return $$$2$$$ or $$$3$$$. Out of the two instructions the first one is chosen (since in case of equal values, the least number is preferred), so the interactor returns $$$a^{23}_1=2$$$.\nFor the query $$$(1, 5)$$$, it can return $$$1$$$ or $$$3$$$. Out of the two instructions the first one is chosen, so the interactor returns $$$a^{13}_1=1$$$.\nIn the fifth query $$$(2, 4)$$$, the numbers are guessed correctly, the player wins.",
