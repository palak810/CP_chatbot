    "statement": "Abendsen assigned a mission to Juliana. In this mission, Juliana has a rooted tree with n vertices. Vertex number 1 is the root of this tree. Each vertex can be either black or white. At first, all vertices are white. Juliana is asked to process q queries. Each query is one of three types:\nCan you help Juliana to process all these queries?\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 n 10^5, 1 q 10^5) — the number of vertices and the number of queries.\nThe second line contains n-1 integers p_2, p_3, , p_n (1 p_i<i), where p_i means that there is an edge between vertices i and p_i. \nEach of the next q lines contains two integers t_i and v_i (1 t_i 3, 1 v_i n) — the type of the i-th query and the vertex of the i-th query.\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.\nFor each query of type 3, print \"black\" if the vertex is black; otherwise, print \"white\".\nThe first example is shown on the picture below.\nThe second example is shown on the picture below.",
