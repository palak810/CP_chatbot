  "title": "B. Binary String Constructing",
  "statement": "You are given three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$x$$$. Your task is to construct a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n = a + b$$$ such that there are exactly $$$a$$$ zeroes, exactly $$$b$$$ ones and exactly $$$x$$$ indices $$$i$$$ (where $$$1 \\le i < n$$$) such that $$$s_i \\ne s_{i + 1}$$$. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.\nFor example, for the string \"01010\" there are four indices $$$i$$$ such that $$$1 \\le i < n$$$ and $$$s_i \\ne s_{i + 1}$$$ ($$$i = 1, 2, 3, 4$$$). For the string \"111001\" there are two such indices $$$i$$$ ($$$i = 3, 5$$$).\nRecall that binary string is a non-empty sequence of characters where each character is either 0 or 1.\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \\le a, b \\le 100, 1 \\le x < a + b)$$$.\nPrint only one string $$$s$$$, where $$$s$$$ is any binary string satisfying conditions described above. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.\nAll possible answers for the first example:\nAll possible answers for the second example:",
