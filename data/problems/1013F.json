    "statement": "There are two strings s and t, consisting only of letters a and b. You can make the following operation several times: choose a prefix of s, a prefix of t and swap them. Prefixes can be empty, also a prefix can coincide with a whole string. \nYour task is to find a sequence of operations after which one of the strings consists only of a letters and the other consists only of b letters. The number of operations should be minimized.\nThe first line contains a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 2·105).\nThe second line contains a string t (1 ≤ |t| ≤ 2·105).\nHere |s| and |t| denote the lengths of s and t, respectively. It is guaranteed that at least one of the strings contains at least one a letter and at least one of the strings contains at least one b letter.\nThe first line should contain a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 5·105) — the number of operations.\nEach of the next n lines should contain two space-separated integers ai, bi — the lengths of prefixes of s and t to swap, respectively.\nIf there are multiple possible solutions, you can print any of them. It's guaranteed that a solution with given constraints exists.\nIn the first example, you can solve the problem in two operations:\nIn the second example, the strings are already appropriate, so no operations are needed.",
