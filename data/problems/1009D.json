  "title": "D. Relatively Prime Graph",
  "statement": "Let's call an undirected graph $$$G = (V, E)$$$ relatively prime if and only if for each edge $$$(v, u) \\in E$$$  $$$GCD(v, u) = 1$$$ (the greatest common divisor of $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ is $$$1$$$). If there is no edge between some pair of vertices $$$v$$$ and $$$u$$$ then the value of $$$GCD(v, u)$$$ doesn't matter. The vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$|V|$$$.\nConstruct a relatively prime graph with $$$n$$$ vertices and $$$m$$$ edges such that it is connected and it contains neither self-loops nor multiple edges.\nIf there exists no valid graph with the given number of vertices and edges then output \"Impossible\".\nIf there are multiple answers then print any of them.\nThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 10^5$$$) — the number of vertices and the number of edges.\nIf there exists no valid graph with the given number of vertices and edges then output \"Impossible\".\nOtherwise print the answer in the following format:\nThe first line should contain the word \"Possible\".\nThe $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$m$$$ lines should contain the $$$i$$$-th edge $$$(v_i, u_i)$$$ of the resulting graph ($$$1 \\le v_i, u_i \\le n, v_i \\neq u_i$$$). For each pair $$$(v, u)$$$ there can be no more pairs $$$(v, u)$$$ or $$$(u, v)$$$. The vertices are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$.\nIf there are multiple answers then print any of them.\nHere is the representation of the graph from the first example:",
