    "statement": "Natasha is going to fly on a rocket to Mars and return to Earth. Also, on the way to Mars, she will land on n - 2 intermediate planets. Formally: we number all the planets from 1 to n. 1 is Earth, n is Mars. Natasha will make exactly n flights: 1  2   n  1.\nFlight from x to y consists of two phases: take-off from planet x and landing to planet y. This way, the overall itinerary of the trip will be: the 1-st planet  take-off from the 1-st planet  landing to the 2-nd planet  2-nd planet  take-off from the 2-nd planet    landing to the n-th planet  the n-th planet  take-off from the n-th planet  landing to the 1-st planet  the 1-st planet.\nThe mass of the rocket together with all the useful cargo (but without fuel) is m tons. However, Natasha does not know how much fuel to load into the rocket. Unfortunately, fuel can only be loaded on Earth, so if the rocket runs out of fuel on some other planet, Natasha will not be able to return home. Fuel is needed to take-off from each planet and to land to each planet. It is known that 1 ton of fuel can lift off a_i tons of rocket from the i-th planet or to land b_i tons of rocket onto the i-th planet. \nFor example, if the weight of rocket is 9 tons, weight of fuel is 3 tons and take-off coefficient is 8 (a_i = 8), then 1.5 tons of fuel will be burnt (since 1.5  8 = 9 + 3). The new weight of fuel after take-off will be 1.5 tons. \nPlease note, that it is allowed to burn non-integral amount of fuel during take-off or landing, and the amount of initial fuel can be non-integral as well.\nHelp Natasha to calculate the minimum mass of fuel to load into the rocket. Note, that the rocket must spend fuel to carry both useful cargo and the fuel itself. However, it doesn't need to carry the fuel which has already been burnt. Assume, that the rocket takes off and lands instantly.\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2  n  1000) — number of planets.\nThe second line contains the only integer m (1  m  1000) — weight of the payload.\nThe third line contains n integers a_1, a_2, , a_n (1  a_i  1000), where a_i is the number of tons, which can be lifted off by one ton of fuel.\nThe fourth line contains n integers b_1, b_2, , b_n (1  b_i  1000), where b_i is the number of tons, which can be landed by one ton of fuel. \nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than 10^9 tons of fuel.\nIf Natasha can fly to Mars through (n - 2) planets and return to Earth, print the minimum mass of fuel (in tons) that Natasha should take. Otherwise, print a single number -1.\nIt is guaranteed, that if Natasha can make a flight, then it takes no more than 10^9 tons of fuel.\nThe answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^{-6}. Formally, let your answer be p, and the jury's answer be q. Your answer is considered correct if {|p - q|}{{(1, |q|)}}  10^{-6}.\nLet's consider the first example.\nInitially, the mass of a rocket with fuel is 22 tons.\nIn the second case, the rocket will not be able even to take off from Earth.",
