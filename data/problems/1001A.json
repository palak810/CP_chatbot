  "statement": "You are given a qubit in state  and an integer sign.\nYour task is to convert the given qubit to state  if sign = 1 or  if sign =  - 1.\nYou have to implement an operation which takes a qubit and an integer as an input and has no output. The \"output\" of your solution is the state in which it left the input qubit.\nYour code should have the following signature:",
