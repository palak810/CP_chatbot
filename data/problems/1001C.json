  "statement": "You are given N qubits (1 ≤ N ≤ 8) in zero state . Your task is to create Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state on them:\nNote that for N = 1 and N = 2 GHZ state becomes states  and  from the previous tasks, respectively.\nYou have to implement an operation which takes an array of N qubits as an input and has no output. The \"output\" of your solution is the state in which it left the input qubits.\nYour code should have the following signature:",
