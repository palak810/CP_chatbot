    "statement": "Students from many different parts of Russia and abroad come to Summer Informatics School. You marked the hometowns of the SIS participants on a map.\nNow you decided to prepare an interesting infographic based on this map. The first thing you chose to do is to find three cities on this map, such that they form a triangle with area S.\nThe first line of input contains two integers n and S (3  n  2000, 1  S  2  10^{18}) — the number of cities on the map and the area of the triangle to be found.\nThe next n lines contain descriptions of the cities, one per line. Each city is described by its integer coordinates x_i, y_i (-10^9  x_i, y_i  10^9). \nIt is guaranteed that all cities are located at distinct points. It is also guaranteed that no three cities lie on the same line.\nIf the solution doesn't exist — print «No».\nOtherwise, print «Yes», followed by three pairs of coordinates (x, y) — the locations of the three cities, which form the triangle of area S.",
