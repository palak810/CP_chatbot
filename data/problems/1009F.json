    "statement": "You are given a rooted undirected tree consisting of n vertices. Vertex 1 is the root.\nLet's denote a depth array of vertex x as an infinite sequence [d_{x, 0}, d_{x, 1}, d_{x, 2}, ], where d_{x, i} is the number of vertices y such that both conditions hold:\nThe dominant index of a depth array of vertex x (or, shortly, the dominant index of vertex x) is an index j such that:\nFor every vertex in the tree calculate its dominant index.\nThe first line contains one integer n (1  n  10^6) — the number of vertices in a tree.\nThen n - 1 lines follow, each containing two integers x and y (1  x, y  n, x  y). This line denotes an edge of the tree.\nIt is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.\nOutput n numbers. i-th number should be equal to the dominant index of vertex i.",
