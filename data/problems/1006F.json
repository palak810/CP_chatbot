    "statement": "There is a rectangular grid of size n  m. Each cell has a number written on it; the number on the cell (i, j) is a_{i, j}. Your task is to calculate the number of paths from the upper-left cell (1, 1) to the bottom-right cell (n, m) meeting the following constraints:\nFind the number of such paths in the given grid.\nThe first line of the input contains three integers n, m and k (1  n, m  20, 0  k  10^{18}) — the height and the width of the grid, and the number k.\nThe next n lines contain m integers each, the j-th element in the i-th line is a_{i, j} (0  a_{i, j}  10^{18}).\nPrint one integer — the number of paths from (1, 1) to (n, m) with xor sum equal to k.\nAll the paths from the first example: \nAll the paths from the second example: ",
