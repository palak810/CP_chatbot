  "title": "A. Single Wildcard Pattern Matching",
  "statement": "You are given two strings $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$. The string $$$s$$$ consists of lowercase Latin letters and at most one wildcard character '*', the string $$$t$$$ consists only of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string $$$s$$$ equals $$$n$$$, the length of the string $$$t$$$ equals $$$m$$$.\nThe wildcard character '*' in the string $$$s$$$ (if any) can be replaced with an arbitrary sequence (possibly empty) of lowercase Latin letters. No other character of $$$s$$$ can be replaced with anything. If it is possible to replace a wildcard character '*' in $$$s$$$ to obtain a string $$$t$$$, then the string $$$t$$$ matches the pattern $$$s$$$.\nFor example, if $$$s=$$$\"aba*aba\" then the following strings match it \"abaaba\", \"abacaba\" and \"abazzzaba\", but the following strings do not match: \"ababa\", \"abcaaba\", \"codeforces\", \"aba1aba\", \"aba?aba\".\nIf the given string $$$t$$$ matches the given string $$$s$$$, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\".\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) â€” the length of the string $$$s$$$ and the length of the string $$$t$$$, respectively.\nThe second line contains string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, which consists of lowercase Latin letters and at most one wildcard character '*'.\nThe third line contains string $$$t$$$ of length $$$m$$$, which consists only of lowercase Latin letters.\nPrint \"YES\" (without quotes), if you can obtain the string $$$t$$$ from the string $$$s$$$. Otherwise print \"NO\" (without quotes).\nIn the first example a wildcard character '*' can be replaced with a string \"force\". So the string $$$s$$$ after this replacement is \"codeforces\" and the answer is \"YES\".\nIn the second example a wildcard character '*' can be replaced with an empty string. So the string $$$s$$$ after this replacement is \"vkcup\" and the answer is \"YES\".\nThere is no wildcard character '*' in the third example and the strings \"v\" and \"k\" are different so the answer is \"NO\".\nIn the fourth example there is no such replacement of a wildcard character '*' that you can obtain the string $$$t$$$ so the answer is \"NO\".",
